## Acknowledgements

Also, I relied on the code from these excellent plugins:

- [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/). Thanks to Tiago Forte for inventing such a great organizational method.
- [obsidian-periodic-notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes). Gave me the inspiration to develop this plugin.
- [obsidian-dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). The underlying plugin uses dataview's query interface.
- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater). Provides decoupled template creation, allowing a very large number of plugins to create files with the help of it.
